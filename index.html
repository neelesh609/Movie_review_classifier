							<h1>Data Mining term Project </h1>
							<h2> Movie Review Classifier </h2>
							<h3>Introduction:</h3>
							<p>The goal of this project is to build a classifier which will be able to predict if the given movie review is positive or negative <br/> 
							For this experiment we have taken about 40,000 reviews for training data , 5000 reviews for development and 5000 reviews for testing the classifier.<br/>
							<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/atulanandjha/imdb-50k-movie-reviews-test-your-bert"> please click here for the dataset </a><br/><br/>

							There are many similar applications on the internet that perform the same action in a more efficient manner. </br>
							<a href="https://freeappsforme.com/apps-for-movie-reviews/"> Please click here to find the top 10 best apps that provide moview revies</a><br/>
							<a href="https://appgrooves.com/app/replika-your-ai-friend-by-luka-inc/negative"> Please click here to find similar apps that segregate the reviews into positive and negative ones.</a><br/><br/>

                              There are a lot other apps apart from these that can segregate a positive and negative reviews . The application i have built 
							  tries to segregate the review into positivie or negative instatntly with almost 86% accuracy.
								</p><br/>

								<h2> WHY ? </h2>

								<p>A lot  of applications (better ones) already exist on the internet that can give a rating once you type your review . a lot of problems
								are being caused because of the "fake reviews" or "neutral reviews" as humans we can figure out what exactly is going on but it is 
								slightly challenging to make a machine understand the same this is why i have made a modest attempt towards making the machine 
								understand the reviews and tell us weather it is positive or negative , and when it comes to neutral reviews my machine tries it bests to
							    predict wether it is on positive side or negative side<p/><br/>

						<h2>Building the Classifiers </h2>
						
						<p>We will build and compare multiple classifiers which may be useful for text classification:<br/><br/>

								1 ) Naive Bayes Classifier<br/>
								2) SVM (Support Vector Machine) Classifier<br/>
								3) Random Forest Classifier</p>

								<p>there are various other text classifiers but for this experiment we shall use the above three classifiers.</p><br/><br/>

                            <h2>Naive Bayes Classifier. </h2>

							<h4>Naive bayes method is one of the best method for text classification and text analysis in machine learning  
								Naive bayes is not a single algorithm its a family of algorithms<br/>

								many of those algorithms are:<br/><br/>

								Binomial naive bayes. - it is useful for features that are binare ie. 0 and 1 <br/><br/>
								Multinomial naive bayes. it is the most ideal algorithm for text classification <br/><br/>
								Gaussian naive bayes. it is ideal for features that follow a normal distribution , or features that are continuous.<br/><br/>
						
						        For our experiment we use Multinomial Naive Bayes using smoothing: <br/>
                                
								We calculate both accuracy and mean squared error and later decide which parameter to use to decide the best classifier.

						<h2> Support Vector Machine (SVM)</h2>
						
						
						<p> Amongst the many text classifiers SVM is also one of the most efficcient and faster classifier
							According to the documentation of scikit-learn : <br/>
								For large datasets consider using sklearn.svm.LinearSVC and not sklearn.svm.SVC
								So, we will go with sklearn.svm.LinearSVC<br/>

								Support vector machine decides the best boundary between vectors that belong to a group<br/>
								It can be applied to any kind of vector which encode any kind of data. SVM decides where to draw the 
								best line or the hyperplane that divides the data efficiently the space between the category and the hyperplane on both sides 
								decides the accuracy. <br/>

								We will try SVM for C=1 , c=100 and c= 1000

						<h2>Random Forest Classifier </h2>
				

								<p>A Random Forest Classifier is a meta estimator that fits a number of decision tree classifiers 
									on various sub samples of dataset and uses averaging to improve the accuracy and control overfitting.<br/>

									In other words random  decision forests are ensemble learning method for classification by building decision trees 
									during training time and outputs the mean prediction of indivisual trees.

									The number of trees in the forest (n_estimators) is considerd as one of the most important factor for getting better accuracy.
                                    We will use n_estimators = 10 and 50 to check the results.

						<h2>Comparing the accuracies </h2>
				

								<p>Here we compare the accuracies to find the best classifier , we can consider the mean sqaured error as well but I have 
									chosen accuracies to compute the same as our movie reviewer needs high accuracy to predict if the data is positive or negative.

                        <h2>Contributions</h2>

						

						<p>My Major contribution to this would be choosing the appropriate classifiers required for text classification.
							and increasing the accuracy so that the machine would appropriately predict weather the review is positive or not.
							I do have used some references inorder to build the classiiers but also tried to use some hyperparameters among them to increse its accuracies.
							overall I have been able to push the accuracy from 66% to 85% and the machine is almost pinpoint in deciding weather the review is positive or negative

						</p>

						<h2>Challenges</h2>



					
						<p>My major challenge was to choose and build the appropriate classifiers. data cleaning was not a mjor issue but to choose the 
							right classifier I had to learn how they function and thus choose the right ones for this experiment.
							according to my knowledge i have chosen the best ones but there might be better classifiers as well.
							And to complete the project within a limited timeframe due to other exams was also one of the challenges I faced !

						<h2>Acknowledgement</h2>

						<p>I would like to thank Dr.Deok Gun Park for this wonderful session of data mining classes and this amaazing opportunity to
							apply the learning in the form of this project. It has added great value to my resume , in the end it was a pleasure taking up these classes
							Thank you once again Dr.Park !
